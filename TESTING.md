## Code Validation
### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.
Pages which do not require a user to be logged in have been validated using the live link. The source code of pages that require log in to be viewed were manually tested by visiting each page, right clicking and selecting "View page source". This compiled code was then copied and pasted into the W3C HTML validator. For this reason,k the W3C URL is shown as "n/a" in the table below.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper-connect.herokuapp.com%2F) | ![Home page](documentation/testing/html/home.png) | Pass: No errors |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live site if you only have a single CSS file using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to the page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdragon-fire-fly.github.io%2Fdeveloper_matcher

If you have multiple CSS files, then individual [validation by input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
is recommended for the additional CSS files.

**IMPORTANT**: Third-Party tools

If you're using extras like Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, then sometimes the validator
will attempt to also validate this code, even if it's not part of your own actual code.
You are not required to validate the external libraries or frameworks!

| checkout.css | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining CSS files |

### JavaScript

No Javascript was used in this project.

### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.
In addition, I used the [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) pep8 validation tool, installed into my VSCode environment throughout the development of the project.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

The CI Python Linter can be used two different ways.
- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click on.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).
    - Examples:

    | File | CI URL | Raw URL | Combined |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | PP3 *run.py* file | `https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/main/run.py` | https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/main/run.py |
    | Boutique Ado *settings.py* | `https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/main/boutique_ado/settings.py` | https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/main/boutique_ado/settings.py |

It's recommended to validate each file using the API URL.
This will give you a custom URL which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a file to validate it again in the future.
Use the steps above to generate your own custom URLs for each Python file.

**IMPORTANT**: Django settings.py

The Django settings.py file comes with 4 lines that are quite long, and will throw the `E501 line too long` error.
This is default behavior, but can be fixed by adding `# noqa` to the end of those lines.

`noqa` = **NO Quality Assurance**

Example:

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]
```

**NOTE**: You must include 2 *spaces* before the `#`, and 1 *space* after the `#`.

Do not use `# noqa` all over your project just to clear down validation errors!
This can still cause a project to fail, for failing to fix actual PEP8 validation errors.

Sometimes strings or variables get too long, or long `if` conditional statements.
These are acceptable instances to use the `# noqa`.

When trying to fix "line too long" errors, try to avoid using `/` to split lines.
A better approach would be to use any type of opening bracket, and hit Enter just after that.
Any opening bracket type will work: `(`, `[`, `{`.
By using an opening bracket, Python knows where to appropriately indent the next line of code,
without having to "guess" yourself and attempt to tab to the correct indentation level.

Example:

```python
return HttpResponse(
    content=(
        f'Webhook received: {event["type"]} | '
        'SUCCESS: Verified order already in database'
    ),
    status=200
)
```

**IMPORTANT**: migration and pycache files

You do not have to ever validate files from the `migrations/` or `pycache/` folders!
Ignore these `.py` files, and validate just the files that you've created or modified.

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.
All screenshots in the main [README.md](README.md) file were taken on Chrome as Chrome was used during the development of this project.

## Responsiveness

All pages were tested in the following 4 screen sizes:
- Small mobile device (320px)
- Large mobile device (425px)
- Tablet (768px)
- Desktop (1440px)

Screenshots of all pages in these different screen sizes may be found in the [README.md](README.md) file under "Features".

One example is provided below:

## Lighthouse Audit

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.
All scores came back with a score of at least 50, in many cases much higher than this. Most of the reasons for lower scores were due to the presence of user uploaded large image files that are not properly scaled or next-gen fomet (e.g. WebP). The pictures used for sample user accounts and projects were not updated as this would not be representative of genuine user uploaded pictures and thus would artificially skew the lighthouse scores. In the future, an image uploader could be used to convert user uploaded pictures to WebP format automatically before storage in the database.
Another reason for the longer laoding time is the use of "Minty" from Bootswatch. This means that a lot of unused CSS must be loaded by the browser, lengthening loading times. By removing this Bootswatch theme and sticking to a simpler custom CSS file with use of the Bootstrap CDN delivery option. 
Overall, the lighthouse scores were deemed high enough for the minimum viable product.

## Defensive Programming

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

Flask/Django:
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

## User Story Testing

Each of the User Stories mentioned in the [README.md](README.md) file were tested to ensure correct functionality and complete implementation of the User Story.

[User Story testing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gGXyeVyqV9Qn-6OWgzcTl8FbropnZFla_UFe-G648LY/edit#gid=0) is linked here in an external Google sheet.

For each User Story, the Epic to which the User Story belongs is listed along with the user story number, the title of the User Story, it's MoSCow prioritation and each of the acceptance criteria for the User Story. There is then a column each for whether the feature was implemented and (if implemented) whether it is working correctly. There is also a screenshot where relevant to demonstrate the implementation of the User Sotry.


## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)
I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

![Unittests](documentation/testing/python/unittests.png)

The unittests run for the project are listed below, seperated by Django app and file (models or views)

For **app_user** app:
**views.py**

#### Unit Test Issues
The following unittest was implemented for testing the deletion of a project picture.


```python
    @mock.patch("cloudinary.uploader.upload")
    def test_delete_project_picture_post(self, mock_uploader_upload):
        # logging in project owner
        self.client.force_login(self.user1)

        # setup - add a mocked picture
        template = "app_home/project_picture.html"
        url = reverse(
            "app_home:add-project-pic", kwargs={"pk": self.project1.pk}
        )

        # number of pics before upload
        no_pics = len(self.project1.project_pic.all())
        # mocking
        mock_uploader_upload = "picture.jpg"
        # define URL & image
        mocked_picture = SimpleUploadedFile(
            "picture.jpg", b"file_content", content_type="image/jpeg"
        )
        # add the mocked picture to the project
        response = self.client.post(url, {"project_picture": mocked_picture})

        # check that mocked picture is set
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project1.project_pic.all()), no_pics + 1)
        picture_object = self.project1.project_pic.get(project=self.project1.pk)

        # now delete the mocked picture
        template = "app_home/project_picture.html"
        url = reverse(
            "app_home:delete-project-pic", kwargs={"pk": picture_object.pk}
        )
        response = self.client.get(url)
        # test that the picture is deleted
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project1.project_pic.all()), no_pics)

```

Throughout development, this test was working, however, at some later point it was returning the error `IndexError: list index out of range` in reference to the `picture_object = self.project1.project_pic.get(project=self.project1.pk)` variable assignment.

![Index out of range](documentation/testing/python/unittests-with-fail.png)

It is unclear why this error should be thrown, and when investigating using a breakpoint, the `self.project1.project_pic.get(project=self.project1.pk)` variable is correctly accessible.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Delete project pic  | get  | project owner  | ensure that mocked picture has been added first  | self.assertEqual(len(self.project1.project_pic.all()), no_pics + 1)    |

### GitHub CI
For this project, a [Continuous Integration (CI) workflow](https://github.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/actions) was implemented using GitHub Actions. This means that the requested tests may be run on the project each time a push or a pull request is performed. The specifics of the CI workflow can be found in the [ci.yml file in the project](https://github.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml). The CI performs 15 steps including importing requirements, making relevant database migrations, performing unittests and performing a pep8 compliance check using Black (with a custom line-length of 79 characters).

Once set up, a CI worflow is extremely helpful for monitoring the quality of the code and ensuring that all unittests continue to run successfully when code is altered or added to.

An example of a successful ci run is shown below:  
![GitHub CI workflow run](documentation/testing/github_ci.png)

Unfortunately, the CI appears unable to access the SECRET_KEY value stored in Github and therefore requires a hard coded SECRET_KEY in the settings.py file. This was accomplished throughout development with the following code:  
```python
if os.getenv("GITHUB_WORKFLOW"):
    SECRET_KEY = (
        "MySuperInsecureSecretKeyOnlyForGithubActionsThatIsLongerThan50Chars"
    )
else:
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY", "")
```

This provided the real secret key value for the local and deployed version, but supplied a fake secret_key value to GitHub Actions. However, for official release, this was removed from the settings.py file. The database migrations therefore fail in the ci and the unittests and pep8 check cannot be run. To reinstate the GitHub CI, a secret key must be provided.

## Unfixed Bugs

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
