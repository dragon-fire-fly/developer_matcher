## Code Validation
### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.
Pages which do not require a user to be logged in have been validated using the live link. The source code of pages that require log in to be viewed were manually tested by visiting each page, right clicking and selecting "View page source". This compiled code was then copied and pasted into the W3C HTML validator. For this reason, the W3C URL is shown as "n/a" in the table below.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper-connect.herokuapp.com%2F) | ![Home page](documentation/testing/html/home.png) | Pass: No errors |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

There are two sources for the CSS for the website - most comes from an import of Bootstrap and some comes from a custom CSS file (static/css/style.css). The Jigsaw validator attempted to validate all the CSS from the site, but any errors or warnings arising from the Bootstrap import were ignored in this case as they come from a third party.

Below is a table summary for the CSS code validation.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper-connect.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) | ![style.css](documentation/testing/css/valid.png) | Pass: No Errors (custom CSS code can be seen at the bottom of the "validated CSS" section) |

| x | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper-connect.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) | ![warnings](documentation/testing/css/warnings.png) | 368 warnings, all coming from bootstrap import |

### JavaScript

No Javascript was used in this project.

### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.
In addition, I used the [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) pep8 validation tool, installed into my VSCode environment throughout the development of the project.

In the settings.py file, there are 4 lines which come as default with Django which throw a "line too long" error and cannot be broken down without compromising code functionality. For these lines (settings.py 184, 189, 194 and 199) have had the `# noqa` comment added to the end of them to exclude them from code validation. These are the only lines which are exempted in this way.


```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]
```

Below are the results of running the [Code Institute PEP8 linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/):

## Browser Compatibility
I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.
All screenshots in the main [README.md](README.md) file were taken on Chrome as Chrome was used during the development of this project. In addition, the application was tested on [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) (on Linux) and [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (on Mac). The screenshots for these browsers can be found below.

## Responsiveness

All pages were tested in the following 4 screen sizes:
- Small mobile device (320px)
- Large mobile device (425px)
- Tablet (768px)
- Desktop (1440px)

Screenshots of all pages in these different screen sizes may be found in the [README.md](README.md) file under "Features".

One example is provided below:
![Developer overview page](documentation/features/developer-overview-page.png)

## Lighthouse Audit
I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.
All scores came back with a score of at least 50, in many cases much higher than this. Most of the reasons for lower scores were due to the presence of user uploaded large image files that are not properly scaled or next-gen fomet (e.g. WebP). The pictures used for sample user accounts and projects were not updated as this would not be representative of genuine user uploaded pictures and thus would artificially skew the lighthouse scores. In the future, an image uploader could be used to convert user uploaded pictures to WebP format automatically before storage in the database.
Overall, the lighthouse scores were deemed high enough for the minimum viable product.

## Accessibility
Accessibility of websites is extremely important so that users from all backgrounds can enjoy a website. Good website accessibility includes easy to read text (with a good contrast between text and background) as well as appropriately labelling elements so they may be read by screen reader technology.

### Eightshapes
Contrast between the colours used in this project were assessed using an [eight-shapes contrast grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23000%0D%0A%235A5A5A%0D%0A%2378C2AD%0D%0A%23F3969A%0D%0A%23C63D17%0D%0A%23FFCE67%0D%0A%23006400&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp). This gives a rating to show whether two colours are suitable to use together in terms of accessibility. If the rating is less than 4.5 (AA rating), the colour combination should not be used to display text on background (unless the text is very large). A combination with a rating of less than 3 (AA18 rating) should never be used.  

![Eight shapes grid](documentation/testing/accessibility/eight-shapes-grid.png)  
Following this assessment, many of the colour combinations on the site were changed to improve the contrast and make the site more accessible. In most cases, this resulted in white text being changed to dark grey or black. Some examples are shown below:  
![Improved contrast](documentation/testing/accessibility/improved-contrast.png)


### WAVE Accessibility Testing
| Page | Screenshot(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home  | ![Home page](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/home.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |
| Login  | ![Login](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/signin.png) | 2 x redundant links because the login page contains a link to iteslf (in the navbar) and 2 links to the register page. These alerts were ignored as one link is in the nav bar and the other came with Django Allauth |
| Register  | ![Register](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/register.png) | 1 x redundant links because the register page contains a link to iteslf (in the navbar). This alert was ignored as the redundant link is in the navbar |
| About  | ![About](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/about.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |
| Developer Overview  | ![Developer Overview](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/developer-overview.png) | 8 alerts due to redundant links (both the image and title lead to the individual profile page). These alerts were ignored as this was a design choice for the site. To remove these alerts, the <a> tag on either the image or the title could be removed. |
| Individual profile  | ![Individual profile](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/individual-profile.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |
| Project Overview  | ![Project Overview](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/project-overview.png) | 5 alerts due to redundant links (both the image and title lead to the individual project page). These alerts were ignored as this was a design choice for the site. To remove these alerts, the <a> tag on either the image or the title could be removed. |
| Individual project  | ![Individual project](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/individual-project.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |
| Edit project  | ![Edit project](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/edit-project.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |
| User Profile  | ![User profile](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/user-profile.png) | 1 alert due to "suspicious alternative text" as the alt text is "Your profile image". This was not updated to something more descriptive, as this field is a user uploaded image and is it therefore unknown what a more appropriate image description could be. |
| Profile pictures  | ![Profile pictures](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/profile-pictures.png) | 2 x alerts due to "suspicious alternative text" as the alt text is "Your profile image". This was not updated to something more descriptive, as this field is a user uploaded image and is it therefore unknown what a more appropriate image description could be. There was also 1 alert as "A nearby image has the same alternative text". This is due to the alt-text field being generated in a for loop and therefore each user uploaded image has the same alt text. |
| Edit profile  | ![Edit profile](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/edit-profile.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |
| Messages inbox  | ![About](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/inbox.png) | 1 redundant link present as both the thumbnail img and the user name lead to the user's individual profile. This alert was ignored as this was a design choice. To remove this alert, the <a> tag on either the image or the user name could be removed. |
| Messages sent items  | ![Sent messages](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/msgs-sent.png) | The WAVE assessment tool identified 3 errors due to "empty links". However, when the code is inspected, there is infact  |
| New message  | ![New message](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/new-msg.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |
| Edit message  | ![Edit message](documentation/testing/accessibility/wave/edit_msg.png) | Pass: No errors or alerts |

## User Story Testing

Each of the User Stories mentioned in the [README.md](README.md) file were tested to ensure correct functionality and complete implementation of the User Story.

[User Story testing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gGXyeVyqV9Qn-6OWgzcTl8FbropnZFla_UFe-G648LY/edit#gid=0) is linked here in an external Google sheet.

For each User Story, the Epic to which the User Story belongs is listed along with the user story number, the title of the User Story, it's MoSCow prioritation and each of the acceptance criteria for the User Story. There is then a column each for whether the feature was implemented and (if implemented) whether it is working correctly. There is also a screenshot where relevant to demonstrate the implementation of the User Sotry.


## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)
I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

![Unittests](documentation/testing/python/unittests.png)

The unittests run for the project are listed below, seperated by Django app and file (models or views)

#### Unit Test Issues
The following unittest was implemented for testing the deletion of a project picture.


```python
    @mock.patch("cloudinary.uploader.upload")
    def test_delete_project_picture_post(self, mock_uploader_upload):
        # logging in project owner
        self.client.force_login(self.user1)

        # setup - add a mocked picture
        template = "app_home/project_picture.html"
        url = reverse(
            "app_home:add-project-pic", kwargs={"pk": self.project1.pk}
        )

        # number of pics before upload
        no_pics = len(self.project1.project_pic.all())
        # mocking
        mock_uploader_upload = "picture.jpg"
        # define URL & image
        mocked_picture = SimpleUploadedFile(
            "picture.jpg", b"file_content", content_type="image/jpeg"
        )
        # add the mocked picture to the project
        response = self.client.post(url, {"project_picture": mocked_picture})

        # check that mocked picture is set
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project1.project_pic.all()), no_pics + 1)
        picture_object = self.project1.project_pic.get(project=self.project1.pk)

        # now delete the mocked picture
        template = "app_home/project_picture.html"
        url = reverse(
            "app_home:delete-project-pic", kwargs={"pk": picture_object.pk}
        )
        response = self.client.get(url)
        # test that the picture is deleted
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project1.project_pic.all()), no_pics)

```

Throughout development, this test was working, however, at some later point it was returning the error `IndexError: list index out of range` in reference to the `picture_object = self.project1.project_pic.get(project=self.project1.pk)` variable assignment.

![Index out of range](documentation/testing/python/unittests-with-fail.png)

It is unclear why this error should be thrown, and when investigating using a breakpoint, the `self.project1.project_pic.get(project=self.project1.pk)` variable is correctly accessible.

 Delete project picture

| Function Tested | Function Type | Status | Testing for.. | Assert Statement  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Delete project pic  | get  | project owner  | ensure that mocked picture has been added first  | self.assertEqual(len(self.project1.project_pic.all()), no_pics + 1)    |
|   |   |   | mocked picture has been deleted  | self.assertEqual(len(self.project1.project_pic.all()), no_pics)    |

### GitHub CI  
For this project, a [Continuous Integration (CI) workflow](https://github.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/actions) was implemented using GitHub Actions. This means that the requested tests may be run on the project each time a push or a pull request is performed. The specifics of the CI workflow can be found in the [ci.yml file in the project](https://github.com/dragon-fire-fly/developer_matcher/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml). The CI performs 15 steps including importing requirements, making relevant database migrations, performing unittests and performing a pep8 compliance check using Black (with a custom line-length of 79 characters).

Once set up, a CI worflow is extremely helpful for monitoring the quality of the code and ensuring that all unittests continue to run successfully when code is altered or added to.

An example of a successful ci run is shown below:  
![GitHub CI workflow run](documentation/testing/github_ci.png)
